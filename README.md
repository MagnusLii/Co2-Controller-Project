### Individual macros
Macros for wireless communication are defined in `src\wireless-tasks\connection_defines.h`<br>
The file needs to be created manually and should contain the following macros:<br>
```c
#define API_KEY "XXX"
#define TALK_BACK_API_KEY "XXX"
#define WIFI_SSID "XXX"
#define WIFI_PASSWORD "XXX"
#define THINGSPEAK_IP "3.224.58.169"
#define THINGSPEAK_HOSTNAME "api.thingspeak.com"
#define THINGSPEAK_PORT 80
```
